    content: `In a small garden behind an old house lived a family of rabbits. Every morning, they would hop around looking for fresh vegetables to eat. The garden had carrots, lettuce, and tomatoes growing in neat rows.

One day, a young rabbit named Max discovered a new vegetable patch. It had the biggest, orangest carrots he had ever seen! He was so excited that he called his whole family to share his discovery.

The family worked together to harvest the vegetables, making sure to leave enough for tomorrow. They even planted new seeds to help the garden grow. From that day on, the rabbits took special care of their garden, and it became the most beautiful one in the neighborhood.`,
