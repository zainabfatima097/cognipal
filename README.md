# 🧠 CogniPal - Reimagining Alzheimer’s Support with Empathy & AI

> “Imagine waking up one day… and the faces you love, the memories you’ve lived, slowly begin to fade.”  
> That’s the everyday reality for millions battling Alzheimer’s. CogniPal was built to change that.

## 🌟 What is CogniPal?

**CogniPal** is a gamified memory-care platform that transforms Alzheimer’s support into something people *want* to use - not just need to use.  
We’re reimagining therapy as an adventure, progress as XP, and support as something human.

Built with empathy, powered by AI, and designed for both **patients** and their **caregivers**, CogniPal brings hope into memory care - one quest at a time.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional memory support tools feel clinical, cold, and often overwhelm both patients and caregivers.  
CogniPal replaces this with a warm, gamified experience where:

- Patients embark on daily quests to improve cognition  
- Caregivers get real-time insights without feeling burdened  
- Everyone feels empowered, not helpless
